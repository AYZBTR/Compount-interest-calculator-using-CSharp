1.Build an interactive program. The program asks some questions.
A child is born. Imagine that the godmother saves 1000 euros (or something else) to the account at that day. At the time of each birthday the godmother deposits to the same account 200 euros (or something else, but this time always the same amount of money). This happens last time when child has the 18th birthday. At that time the child has the right to withdraw every thing. How much money at that time? Annual interest rate is 2 percent.

2. Generate a static method to do the task above. 

Expect a geometric series to exist.
